## 1. Introdution üöÄ

**SHAUR**,  acronym for **S**imple **H**elper **AUR**, is a very minimal and functional AUR helper. Its task is to greatly simplify what well-known AUR helpers do, adding many more functionalities like AUR package tracking. Imagine tackling the climb of Everest: while other AUR helpers force you to struggle along steep and rugged slopes, with Shaur it's like having wings. It lifts you towards the highest peaks with astonishing speed, overcoming every obstacle along the way and taking you directly to the AUR summit without even feeling the fatigue of the ascent.

## 2. Security Notes üìÑüõ°Ô∏è

For security reasons, SHAUR cannot be executed or installed directly by the root user. However, this does not mean that SHAUR does not make use of elevated privileges. In fact, it only utilizes such privileges for specific operations such as **removing** AUR packages from the system and **updating** local packages. 

While most AUR helpers advise against running as the root user, **SHAUR enforces, for security reasons, the necessity of always operating as a normal user.** This control was personally implemented prior to the introduction of a requests handler in the form of an anonymous function.
